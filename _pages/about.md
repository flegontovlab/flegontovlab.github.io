The Flegontov Laboratory, an integral part of the Life Science Research Centre at the University of Ostrava's Faculty of Science, operates at the cutting edge of archaeogenetics. Our mission is to navigate the vast and complex story of human history by analyzing ancient DNA (aDNA) recovered from archaeological remains. We seek to answer fundamental questions about the migrations, admixtures, and deep ancestral relationships that have shaped human populations across millennia.

Our scientific philosophy is built on a powerful feedback loop. We believe that to accurately read the stories written in our genes, we must constantly refine the computational language used to interpret them. Our vision is therefore twofold: to pursue ambitious historical questions that stretch the limits of current knowledge, and to simultaneously drive the innovation of the statistical methods essential for this work. This creates a cycle where challenging historical puzzles inspire methodological development, and these more robust computational tools, in turn, yield clearer, more nuanced views of our shared past. This commitment to rigor and innovation positions our lab not merely as producers of data, but as critical architects of the methods that ensure the integrity of the entire field.
