**Dr. Pavel Flegontov** is the Head of the Laboratory at the University of Ostrava and an Associate in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. Recruited to the University of Ostrava in 2013 for his expertise in microbial genomics, he quickly established a second, parallel research direction focused on human population history.

Dr. Flegontov's research philosophy is defined by the integration of large-scale genomic data analysis with deep methodological scrutiny and robust interdisciplinary collaboration with archaeologists and linguists. His leadership on the groundbreaking *Nature* paper revising the history of the peopling of the Americas and his ongoing work to build a comprehensive genetic history of Asia exemplify the lab's ambitious scientific vision.
